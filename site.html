        <p>What is Discord? It is an easy way to text and call your friends 1 on 1 or in a group. Most of our group projects are done here and Discord uses its own syntax to bring the characters on the screen to life. And with servers, you can have multiple chats and calls going on. Join our server today to get tutoring instantly from any of our staff.
